# Work Experience

I have been keeping myself busy with professional works since 2017 . 
I would often do internships/open source work in my free time (and sometimes during my college too :sweat_smile: )   

I haven't updated this website for sometime, but i am planning to keep atleast this section up to date, as not only it serves as a place to display my professional skills, it will also help me remember , who i was and how far i have come 🧿
