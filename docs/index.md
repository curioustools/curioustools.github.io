This is **Ansh Sachdeva** (aka *root-ansh* ) , a Software Dev from New Delhi,India.

An year ago ,I received [Google certification as an Associate Android Developer](https://www.credential.net/pju5aztf).

!!! quote "Motto"
    *Full of curiosities and ambitions, I am here to leave a mark in the world, by building something bigger than myself, for the betterment of humanity*

I have a simple personal life. I wrote about it in brief [here](removing_the_masks.md) . My resume can be found [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BpPzQY-GZvQwoQhw07bbt4eEhHhtMjAq/view). I also love to share my experiments and findings in the mysterious world of android and tech in [general, which are mentioned here.](https://root-ansh.github.io/notes/tab_notes/blog_summary/) . This whole website runs on markdown and is deployed via github actions, so kudos to [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for creating such an awesome tool!
